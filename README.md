Presently (May 2024), all the notebooks in '`content`' directory work in Voici rendering, **with the exception of `test_file_read.ipynb`**. (That one failing to render in the notebook was due to a known issue at the time for Voici, see [here](https://discourse.jupyter.org/t/bouton-voila-sur-jupyterlite/18505/11?u=fomightez), and there was a workaround for that demonstrated in `test_providing_inside_nb.ipynb`.)

# Voici demo

[Voici](https://github.com/voila-dashboards/voici) deployed as a static site to GitHub Pages, for demo purposes.

It uses [jupyterlite-xeus-python](https://github.com/jupyterlite/xeus-python-kernel) as a default kernel with a pre-built Emscripten environment.
